# Using NLTK to Analyze Text from Novels
This project involves scraping a novel  using the Python package request. The objective is to extract words from the web data using BeautifulSoup and analyze the distribution of these words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). The project highlights the importance of natural language processing tools in handling unstructured data, especially text data. The project will require knowledge of importing web data into Python and working with natural language text.
